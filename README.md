# Who I Am

Hi, I’m Jeremiah, a software engineer with a passion for learning and growth.

My journey into programming hasn’t been easy. I’ve faced moments of doubt, exhaustion, and the harsh realities of online criticism. Like many young programmers, I’ve experienced the mental toll of negative feedback and toxic behavior from those who forget that behind every coder is a person with hopes, struggles, and dreams.

That’s why I founded Logisec - to create a community rooted in compassion, support, and encouragement. I want to make the path into tech easier for others, especially young programmers who might feel lost or discouraged. Everyone deserves a space where they can learn, grow, and share without fear of judgment or hate.

At Logisec, we stand for kindness, integrity, and helping each other rise. Because I believe that when we lift others up, we all succeed.

If you’re just starting out or feeling overwhelmed, know that you’re not alone. Let’s build a better, more compassionate tech community - together.

**Nerd™️ by nature, innovator by choice.**
